\section{Results and Discussion}
Barrier Heights from CI-NEB — Present the rotational and translational barriers for each adsorbate. Compare across species and rationalize trends (binding strength, molecular symmetry, surface corrugation).
Comparison of Thermodynamic Treatments — This is the heart of the report. For each adsorbate, present thermochemical properties (S, Cp, G) as functions of temperature under: (i) pure harmonic treatment, (ii) harmonic with anharmonic corrections, (iii) hindered rotor/translator treatment. Quantify the differences and discuss which species show the largest deviations from harmonic behavior.
Validation — If available, compare against experimental data or high-level calculations. Discuss the accuracy of the ML potentials for these properties.
Implications for Microkinetic Modeling — Connect your findings to practical catalysis modeling. How much do equilibrium constants or rate constants change when using proper hindered motion treatments versus harmonic approximations?
