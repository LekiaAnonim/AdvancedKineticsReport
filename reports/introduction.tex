Open with the broader context: why accurate partition functions matter for heterogeneous catalysis and microkinetic modeling. Discuss the well-known limitations of the harmonic oscillator approximation for weakly-bound adsorbates and frustrated translations/rotations. Introduce Campbell's work on hindered translator/rotor treatments as motivation, then position your contribution—applying these corrections systematically using ML potentials (FairChem, MACE) rather than expensive DFT for barrier calculations.

The computation of accurate thermochemistry is well known among researchers and scientists as the primary factor predicting accurate rate constants and, therefore, reaction rates and equilibrium constants. The difficulty is an order of magnitude higher when treating reactions on solid catalyst surfaces.
