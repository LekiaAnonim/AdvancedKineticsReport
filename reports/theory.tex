\section{Theoretical Background}
This section should be thorough but not a textbook review. Cover:
Statistical Thermodynamics Framework — Establish the partition function formalism and how thermochemical properties (entropy, heat capacity, free energy) derive from it. Define the molecular partition function decomposition relevant to adsorbates.
Harmonic Oscillator Approximation — Present the standard treatment, its assumptions, and known failure modes for soft/anharmonic modes and hindered motions.
Anharmonic Corrections — Describe your approach to anharmonic corrections, whether through perturbation theory, numerical integration over the potential energy surface, or quasi-harmonic methods.
Hindered Rotor and Hindered Translator Models — Present Campbell's treatment explicitly with the relevant equations. Discuss how the barrier heights ($V_{0}$) enter the partition function expressions and the physical interpretation of transitioning between free and frozen limits.
Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band — Brief theoretical treatment of CI-NEB and why it's appropriate for finding the rotational and translational saddle points that define your barrier heights.
