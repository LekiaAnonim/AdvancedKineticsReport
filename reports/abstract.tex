\section{Abstract}
The abstract should concisely state the problem (accurate thermochemical properties for adsorbates), the methodological approach (comparing harmonic, anharmonic, and hindered motion treatments with ML-accelerated potential energy surfaces), and the key findings. For this audience, emphasize both the methodological contribution and the scientific insights.
